###Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋
 
Github tells me this is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repo where I can talk about myself. Although I am not very good at this, here's my attempt.

I am currently a first year student at Grinnell College, Iowa, majoring in Computer Science and Economics.
I am also fond of Mathematics. I'm absolutely love learning, and I'm always looking for ways to grow as a developer.
In addition to software development, I am interested in public policy, volunteering and solving puzzles.


#Following are some of my skills.
  • Proficiency in Java, Python, C, and Javascript (React) 💻,
  • Automating tasks I only need to do once 👷‍♂️,
  • Functioning on 5 hours of sleep 😴,
  • Making attempts at being humorous 🤭,
  • And of course, tackling problems and coming up with creative solutions 👨‍🎨.
