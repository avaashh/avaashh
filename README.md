## Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋
 
Github tells me this is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repo where I can talk about myself. Although I am not very good at this, here's my attempt.

I am currently a second year student at Grinnell College, Iowa, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. 
I'm absolutely love learning, and I'm always looking for ways to grow as a developer.

In addition to software development, I am interested in public policy and volunteering.

Right now, my favorite programming language is Golang, and I am learning ASM (ARM64) to learn embedded programming.

### Following are some of my skills.
  * Proficiency in Java, Python, C, and Javascript (React, React Native) and Golang 💻,
  * Automating tasks I only need to do once 👷‍♂️,
  * Building scalable, consumer facing software (I have two personal projects, each with 800+ users/downloads)
  * Quick learning, and understanding, and eidetic memory.
